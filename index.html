    <h4>Crypto Miners Club is a new site to help <em>you</em> stay informed on top of important crypto currency market developments.</h4>

<p>I&#39;ve been actively mining since late 2013 and in that short amount of time a lot has changed. The speed at which the crypto mining market moves is extremely fast and highly competitive. In order to maximize profits and increase your chances of success, you need timely information. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is a lot of speculation, misinformation, and scamming out there. Not to mention the pumping and dumping of numerous shitcoins. How does someone make sense of it all? I believe it&#39;s with open communication and transparancy.</p>

<p>While I have a small network of friends that pass along information to each other, I felt it would be a great idea to share with a larger audience. My hope is that by helping others, I will recieve help in return.</p>

<p><strong>So let&#39;s do this!</strong></p>

    <h2>Fight the Trend</h2>

<p>If you frequent <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/">BitcoinTalk</a> or <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin">/r/bitcoin</a> you will inevitably come across some <strong>really bad trading advice</strong> asumming the current price of Bitcoin is a value because it is cheaper than it previously was. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought at 800$ in the magnitude of my monthly salary and I am happy with it. I am waiting for it to drop below 400$ because I a planning to double my exposure.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Here is someone whos investment lost almost 40% and is looking to throw good money after bad simply because of a lower buy in price. Is $400 a good buy in price? If we look at the chart we notice a strong downward trend in BTC price since peaking in November of 2013. There are two lines of support around $800 and $525, but <strong>both</strong> of those lines have been breached. A $400 buy feels comfortably round to a novice trader, but there is nothing in the charts to suggest any support at $400.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no telling where we go from here, but the trend continues to be negative and as noted in the latest <a href="/market-conditions-march-27-1013/">Market Conditions update</a>, my suggestion is to sell BTC holdings.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;re done with your sell orders, head over to Investopedia and learn some <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/university/beginner-trading-fundamentals">trading fundamentals</a> and be a better prepared trader.</p>

    <h2>Preorder ASIC Hardware</h2>

<p>The mining community has a bad habit of purchasing hardware that does not yet exist. The most recent example is the <a href="https://www.kncminer.com/products/titan">KNC Titan</a>, a $10k scrypt miner with no set release date that booked <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/20/kncminer-sells-2-million-worth-of-scrypt-mining-machines-in-four-hours">$2M in non-refundable preorders within <strong>4 hours</strong></a>. </p>

<p>This practice is bad for miners for a number of reasons including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Delays</strong>: Since the start of ASIC mining there has yet to be a product delivered on time. Since time is money in the mining world, any delay <em>reduces your chance of break even</em> on your hardware. Butterfly Labs (<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bfl">BFL</a>) is notorious for delaying products until they have no value. Alpha Technologies have been in development since <a href="https://alpha-t.net/news/development-update-29052013">May 2013</a> and have yet to show a product. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Providing Free Loans</strong>: A preorder is little more than a free loan for the manufacturer with no payback time frame. You are effectively trading cash for the prospect of mining in the future.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Funding The Competition</strong>: No one gets hardware sooner or cheaper than the manufacturer. This created a strong financial incentive to delay shipping products to customers in order to mine with their hardware. This practice can be easily argued for by manufacturers as burn-in or quality testing.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>While it is clear that preorders have been bad for customers, the practice continues because it is lucerative for the manufacturers involved. As such, we cannot expect the practice to end any time soon. But one could hope!</p>

<p>Gridseed ASIC miners in particular have seen a huge price decline of over 20% from $250 to $199 or less depending on vendor. To put it another way, the price of these miners is falling faster than the amount of coin value they can generate.</p>

      <a href="/gridseed-and-pi/">Scrypt Mining with a Gridseed ASIC, Raspberry Pi, and Scrypta</a>
      
    </h3>
    <p>Dedicated hardware (ASICs) for scrypt mining finally hit the market in force last month with the release of the <a href="http://www.dualminer.com">DualMiner</a> and <a href="http://www.gridseed.com">Gridseed</a> ASIC mining devices. As expected, early adopters experienced a lot of pain with weak software, faulty hardware, and poor vendor support. However, things quickly improved at the same time an increase in distribution brought about better service from vendors and lower prices. The release of a dedicated <a href="https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=9908.0">Raspberry Pi distribution for Gridseed devices</a> finally made ASICs a viable alternative to GPU mining for most people.</p>

<p>In order to truly understand what these devices are about, I purchased a Gridseed from <a href="http://zoomhash.com">ZoomHash</a>, an unloved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">Raspberry Pi</a> snagged from a coworker, and set out to see how ASICs compares to GPU mining.</p>

<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading panel-title">Gridseed in Hand</div>
  <div class="panel-body text-center">
    <img src="/images/gridseed.jpg" alt="Gridseed" class="img-responsive">
  </div>
</div>

<p>Setting up the Raspberry Pi was a simple matter of copying Scrypta to a SD card and plugging in the Pi. Once booted a web interface, located at the Pi&#39;s ip address, allows configuration of mining pools and displays mining status information. It&#39;s a well designed interface that&#39;s very nice to use.</p>

<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading panel-title">Simply Pretty</div>
  <div class="panel-body text-center">
    <img src="/images/scripta.png" alt="Scripta" class="img-responsive">
  </div>
</div>

<p>Once the Pi is ready, all that&#39;s left to do is to plug the Gridseed into the Pi with a USB cable and power on both the Gridseed and the Pi.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all there is to it! Once booted, you should see the Gridseed hashing at 3.6mh/s on your pool of choice. Better yet, it will draw less than 9W of power while doing so, an order of magnitude less than a GPU mining card.</p>

<p>Adding more Gridseeds gets slightly more complicated in that you will need to add a USB hub since each device requires a port. Each device requires their own power source as well. Using a simple power brick doesn&#39;t scale very well and using a larger power supply requires hacking together your own cables. However, I have no doubt that within the next 30 days a number of out of the box solutions will be on the market.</p>

<p>Overall my experience with Gridseed Scrypt ASICs has been a positive one. So much so that I&#39;ve started downsizing my GPU mining in favor of them.</p>

      <a href="/bitcoin-mining-update-february-2014/">Crypto Mining Update: February 2014</a>
      
    </h3>
    <p>February was quite a busy month. My mining operation has doubled in size which brought about some growing pains due to the need for better heat and space management. I learned the value of USB GPU risers which allowed for better placement of GPUs allowing them to run cooler while also allowing a consolidation down to three motherboards!</p>

<p>Now the rigs are running at comfortable temperatures, but the room temperature is still too warm for comfort. Luckily there&#39;s an abundance of small room temperature management knowledge in the hydroponics community. After a bit of investigation, I now have a plan to better ventilate the basement once some new HVAC hardware arrives.</p>

<p>This month my preferred mining pool, <a href="http://www.middlecoin.com">Middlecoin</a>, kinds of fell apart and had a few horrible days leading to an exodus of miners. Almost overnight half the hash rate of the pool migrated to other pools such as <a href="http://www.clevermining.com">CleverMining</a> and <a href="http://www.wafflepool.com">WafflePool</a>. I spent most of the month mining <a href="http://www.maxcoin.co.uk">MaxCoin</a> which started off well but has seen a steady decline in value. Sure seems like a pump and dump.
Maxcoin was interesting in that it was a SHA-3 coin. The SHA-3 algorithm is less memory intensive and allowed for lower GPU temps and power usage. I&#39;d like to see more alt-coins using SHA-3 but for now I&#39;ve gone back to mining scrypt at CleverMining.</p>

<p>Overall profitability of GPU mining has been relatively stable with CleverMining showing a payout rate of 0.01130 BTC/day/MHs over the past 30 days. (Note: This is no longer true as payout rates for all multipools has dropped nearly 30% since the beginning of March.)</p>

<p>In addition to mining on Clevermining, I&#39;ve also started renting my rigs on <a href="https://www.betarigs.com">BetaRigs</a> which had shown even larger returns. A high initial hash rate is crucial in generating buzz around new coins and pools so people involved in those activities are willing to pay above market rates to support their efforts. Helping with aforementioned pump and dumps?</p>

<p>Below is a chart of daily earnings with January in blue and February in Green. The two dips in the middle of February were due to issues with the MiddleCoin pool. The dip at the end of the month was due to a combination of Maxcoin&#39;s decline and my rigs being rented which pushed a payout into the start of March.</p>

<p>For the month of March I&#39;m going to slow down the growth rate of hash power until I can get power and temperature conditions in better shape.</p>

    </h3>
    <p>If you are interested in building a mining rig but not sure where to start, things just got a lot easier.
Here’s my recommended spec sheet for a rig that, based on current market conditions, provides the best possible bang for the buck.
This build should cost about $1900, produce a hash rate of at least 2.5MH/s, and produce about $460/month.
It should draw about 1050 watts so it will work with any non shared 15 amp or greater circuit in your house.
If you are on a smaller budget you can start with only three GPUs and one PSU saving you $790 and leaving you with the option of expansion in the future.</p>

<p>Note: Prices are constantly in flux so the prices listed be low may not be completely accurate. But as of March 1, 2014 these still represent the best value.
I recommend shopping around at <a href="http://www.newegg.com">NewEgg</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="http://www.frys.com">Frys</a>, <a href="http://www.ncix.com">NCIX</a>, and your local computer stores for the best price.</p>
