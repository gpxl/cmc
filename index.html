    </h3>
    <p>
  Bitcoin values are coming back now that the April 15th PBOC deadline has passed with no declaration of a ban on BTC in China. While there's been a strong bounce in the past couple of days we need to see prices break through the $500-$525 range for a buy signal. Recent drops in the price of Gridseed miners put ROI at a more historically normal 80-90 days. A bit more upside on BTC prices and ASICs might be a deal. 
</p>

<p>
  After months of dread things are finally looking up!

    <p>MinerEu have discounted the new <a href="https://minereu.com/product/gridseed-blade-miner-80-chip-speical-promotion">Gridseed Blade miners</a> from an original price of $3000 to only <strong>$1610</strong>. Although it is listed as a special promotion, this price makes <strong>a lot</strong> more sense as it finally makes the Blade Miner price competitive with Gridseed&#39;s own 5 chip miner, which is down to <a href="http://zoomhash.com/products/batch-15-gridseed-5-chip-320-420-kh-s-asic-scrypt-sha-miner-ships-from-los-angeles">$135 at ZoomHash</a>.

    <p>MinerEU has information on a new 80 chip Gridseed Blade Miner that, unlike previous rumors, appears to be the real thing.

    </h3>
    <p>There&#39;s no two ways about it. <strong>March absolutely sucked for miners.</strong> </p>

<p>The BTC/MHs/day rate dropped in half as altcoin arbitrage opportunities dried up and have yet to recover. It looks like people have quickly tired of the pump and dump schemes of the numerous altcoins that were added in recent months.</p>

<p>Multi-pools have been having a rough time doing much better than a few percent over straight Litecoin or Dogecoin mining, but WafflePool is still my pool of choice for simple convenience of BTC payouts.</p>

<p>I sold off nearly half of my GPU rigs in favor of Gridseed ASICs which took care of the heat issues I was worried about <a href="/bitcoin-mining-update-february-2014">last month</a>. As I mentioned in the latest <a href="/market-conditions-march-30-2014/">market report</a> GPU mining is on it&#39;s way out as ASIC scrypt miners come online.</p>

<p>Whether GPU or ASIC mining, the recent downturn in BTC value has made mining a lot less profitable for existing miners and almost guaranteed it to be non-profitable for new miners.</p>

<p>For now, I&#39;m in a holding pattern with my current rigs as they are still profitable, but I am not investing in more hardware until there&#39;s a signal of improving conditions. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been actively mining since late 2013 and in that short amount of time a lot has changed. The speed at which the crypto mining market moves is extremely fast and highly competitive. In order to maximize profits and increase your chances of success, you need timely information. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is a lot of speculation, misinformation, and scamming out there. Not to mention the pumping and dumping of numerous shitcoins. How does someone make sense of it all? I believe it&#39;s with open communication and transparancy.</p>

<p>While I have a small network of friends that pass along information to each other, I felt it would be a great idea to share with a larger audience. My hope is that by helping others, I will recieve help in return.</p>

    <h2>Fight the Trend</h2>

<p>If you frequent <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/">BitcoinTalk</a> or <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin">/r/bitcoin</a> you will inevitably come across some <strong>really bad trading advice</strong> asumming the current price of Bitcoin is a value because it is cheaper than it previously was. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought at 800$ in the magnitude of my monthly salary and I am happy with it. I am waiting for it to drop below 400$ because I a planning to double my exposure.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Here is someone whos investment lost almost 40% and is looking to throw good money after bad simply because of a lower buy in price. Is $400 a good buy in price? If we look at the chart we notice a strong downward trend in BTC price since peaking in November of 2013. There are two lines of support around $800 and $525, but <strong>both</strong> of those lines have been breached. A $400 buy feels comfortably round to a novice trader, but there is nothing in the charts to suggest any support at $400.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no telling where we go from here, but the trend continues to be negative and as noted in the latest <a href="/market-conditions-march-27-1013/">Market Conditions update</a>, my suggestion is to sell BTC holdings.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;re done with your sell orders, head over to Investopedia and learn some <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/university/beginner-trading-fundamentals">trading fundamentals</a> and be a better prepared trader.</p>
