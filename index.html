    </h3>
    <p>There&#39;s no two ways about it. <strong>March absolutely sucked for miners.</strong> </p>

<p>The BTC/MHs/day rate dropped in half as altcoin arbitrage opportunities dried up and have yet to recover. It looks like people have quickly tired of the pump and dump schemes of the numerous altcoins that were added in recent months.</p>

<p>Multi-pools have been having a rough time doing much better than a few percent over straight Litecoin or Dogecoin mining, but WafflePool is still my pool of choice for simple convenience of BTC payouts.</p>

<p>I sold off nearly half of my GPU rigs in favor of Gridseed ASICs which took care of the heat issues I was worried about <a href="/bitcoin-mining-update-february-2014">last month</a>. As I mentioned in the latest <a href="/market-conditions-march-30-2014/">market report</a> GPU mining is on it&#39;s way out as ASIC scrypt miners come online.</p>

<p>Whether GPU or ASIC mining, the recent downturn in BTC value has made mining a lot less profitable for existing miners and almost guaranteed it to be non-profitable for new miners.</p>

<p>For now, I&#39;m in a holding pattern with my current rigs as they are still profitable, but I am not investing in more hardware until there&#39;s a signal of improving conditions. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been actively mining since late 2013 and in that short amount of time a lot has changed. The speed at which the crypto mining market moves is extremely fast and highly competitive. In order to maximize profits and increase your chances of success, you need timely information. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is a lot of speculation, misinformation, and scamming out there. Not to mention the pumping and dumping of numerous shitcoins. How does someone make sense of it all? I believe it&#39;s with open communication and transparancy.</p>

<p>While I have a small network of friends that pass along information to each other, I felt it would be a great idea to share with a larger audience. My hope is that by helping others, I will recieve help in return.</p>

    <h2>Fight the Trend</h2>

<p>If you frequent <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/">BitcoinTalk</a> or <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin">/r/bitcoin</a> you will inevitably come across some <strong>really bad trading advice</strong> asumming the current price of Bitcoin is a value because it is cheaper than it previously was. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought at 800$ in the magnitude of my monthly salary and I am happy with it. I am waiting for it to drop below 400$ because I a planning to double my exposure.<br>
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/21nz5r/how_many_of_you_bought_for_800_and_do_you_still/cgex7o1">franki1234</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is someone whos investment lost almost 40% and is looking to throw good money after bad simply because of a lower buy in price. Is $400 a good buy in price? If we look at the chart we notice a strong downward trend in BTC price since peaking in November of 2013. There are two lines of support around $800 and $525, but <strong>both</strong> of those lines have been breached. A $400 buy feels comfortably round to a novice trader, but there is nothing in the charts to suggest any support at $400.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no telling where we go from here, but the trend continues to be negative and as noted in the latest <a href="/market-conditions-march-27-1013/">Market Conditions update</a>, my suggestion is to sell BTC holdings.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;re done with your sell orders, head over to Investopedia and learn some <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/university/beginner-trading-fundamentals">trading fundamentals</a> and be a better prepared trader.</p>

    <h2>Preorder ASIC Hardware</h2>

<p>The mining community has a bad habit of purchasing hardware that does not yet exist. The most recent example is the <a href="https://www.kncminer.com/products/titan">KNC Titan</a>, a $10k scrypt miner with no set release date that booked <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/20/kncminer-sells-2-million-worth-of-scrypt-mining-machines-in-four-hours">$2M in non-refundable preorders within <strong>4 hours</strong></a>. </p>

<p>This practice is bad for miners for a number of reasons including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Delays</strong>: Since the start of ASIC mining there has yet to be a product delivered on time. Since time is money in the mining world, any delay <em>reduces your chance of break even</em> on your hardware. Butterfly Labs (<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bfl">BFL</a>) is notorious for delaying products until they have no value. Alpha Technologies have been in development since <a href="https://alpha-t.net/news/development-update-29052013">May 2013</a> and have yet to show a product. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Providing Free Loans</strong>: A preorder is little more than a free loan for the manufacturer with no payback time frame. You are effectively trading cash for the prospect of mining in the future.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Funding The Competition</strong>: No one gets hardware sooner or cheaper than the manufacturer. This created a strong financial incentive to delay shipping products to customers in order to mine with their hardware. This practice can be easily argued for by manufacturers as burn-in or quality testing.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>While it is clear that preorders have been bad for customers, the practice continues because it is lucerative for the manufacturers involved. As such, we cannot expect the practice to end any time soon. But one could hope!</p>

<p>The announcement of the <a href="https://www.kncminer.com/products/titan">KNC Titan</a> last week, and the inevitable spike in mining difficulty it will bring, shocked the mining world and effects are already being seen in the prices of mining hardware. </p>

<p>Gridseed ASIC miners in particular have seen a huge price decline of over 20% from $250 to $199 or less depending on vendor. To put it another way, the price of these miners is falling faster than the amount of coin value they can generate.</p>

<p>Even with the price drop the ability of these devices to break even is questionable so further price drops should be expected as vendors squeeze each others margins in a race to the bottom.</p>
