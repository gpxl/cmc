<h4>Crypto Miners Club is a new site to help <em>you</em> stay informed on top of important crypto currency market developments.</h4>

<p>I&#39;ve been actively mining since late 2013 and in that short amount of time a lot has changed. The speed at which the crypto mining market moves is extremely fast and highly competitive. In order to maximize profits and increase your chances of success, you need timely information. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is a lot of speculation, misinformation, and scamming out there. Not to mention the pumping and dumping of numerous shitcoins. How does someone make sense of it all? I believe it&#39;s with open communication and transparancy.</p>

<p>While I have a small network of friends that pass along information to each other, I felt it would be a great idea to share with a larger audience. My hope is that by helping others, I will recieve help in return.</p>

<p><strong>So let&#39;s do this!</strong></p>
