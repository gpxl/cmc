<p>Curious about Bitcoin mining but not sure where to start? Here&#39;s a quick cheat sheet of resources to get you started.</p>

<h3>The Bitcoin Market</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/?r=5297831b5446868b09000036">Coinbase</a> is a Bitcoin exchange located in San Francisco. They are one of the most well funded Bitcoin companies in the world and provide a high <a href="https://coinbase.com/security">level of security</a> around their services.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cryptsy.com/users/register?refid=105115">Cryptsy</a> is a Bitcoin exchange serving a huge number of coins. Cryptsy provides a crucial link in facilitating the conversion of alt-coins into Bitcoin.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.coinwarz.com/Bitcoin">Coinwarz</a> lists the profitability of various digital currencies. The calculations are done in real-time and are prone to wild swings so it&#39;s not the most reliable data, but it can serve as a good overview of the Bitcoin market.</p>

<p><a href="http://bitcoinity.org/markets">Bitcoinity</a> provides simple Bitcoin value charts for various exchanges. This site displays the current Bitcoin value in your browser tab so it remains useful even when not in focus.</p>

<p><a href="http://bitinfocharts.com">Bitinfocharts</a> shows detailed information on the largest Bitcoin markets. It&#39;s amazing to see how much larger Bitcoin is relative to everything else. The parabolic difficulty curve is even more impressive ;)</p>

<h3>Bitcoin Mining</h3>

<p><a href="https://litecoin.info/Mining_hardware_comparison">GPU Mining Hardware Comparison</a>: This is a reference list of results with various GPU and CPU hardware along with the config settings. You&#39;ll want a card with a high hash rate (kH/s) to power (W) ratio. The card with the best ratio available, the AMD 7950, is discontinued and close to impossible to find at a good price. The r9 280x and r9 290 are good alternatives that are much easier to find.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cryptobadger.com/build-your-own-litecoin-mining-rig">Guide to Building Your Own Litecoin Mining Rig</a>: This guide was the template from which I built my rig. The specific set of parts he lists is nearly impossible to find, but this will give you an idea of what to look for.</p>

<p><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=28402.0">Mining Software: CGMiner 3.7.2</a>: This is the reference thread for CGMiner, the software that will run your miner.</p>

<p><a href="http://middlecoin2.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com">MiddleCoin Mining Pool</a>: This is my go to pool. Middlecoin is an auto-switching pool that seeks the most profitable alt coins to maximize the return on your hashing power. It also auto-exchanges mined coins and pays out in Bitcoin (BTC). Better still, joining the pool is as simple as pointing your miner at it using a Bitcoin wallet address.</p>
