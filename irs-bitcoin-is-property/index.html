<p>An important statement for US based miners from the IRS today.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Bitcoin miners would have to report their earnings as taxable income with a value equal to the worth on the day it was mined. If they mine as part of a business, they would have to pay payroll taxes as well.&quot;</p>
